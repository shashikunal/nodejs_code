Writable: streams to which we can write data. For example, fs.createWriteStream() lets us write data to a file using streams.
Readable: streams from which data can be read. For example: fs.createReadStream() lets us read the contents of a file.
Duplex: streams that are both Readable and Writable. For example, net.Socket
Transform: streams that can modify or transform the data as it is written and read. For example, in the instance of file-compression, you can write compressed data and read decompressed data to and from a file.
